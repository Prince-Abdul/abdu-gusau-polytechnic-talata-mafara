            <p>We provided this website to help students complain about their learning problems. If a school employee, violates a student's right, either the student or the student's parent or guardian can file a complaint to protect those rights. Generally, you can start a complaint at the school itself(and that is the best way where your complaint may be proceed),then move to hierarchy to your state's department of education if your complaint remain unresolved to your satisfaction. If you believe the school has discriminated agaist you or your child in violation of federal law, you can also file a complaint with the US Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR).If a teacher is the source of your problem, you may also be able to submit a discipline report to the agency in your state that is in charge of teacher certification.    </p>
