        <p class="main-background">
            The present day Abdu Gusau Polytechnic, TalataMafara has a long standing history. Its origin
             dates back to the emergence of The Staff Training Centre, Sokoto in 1956, which was 
             eventually renamed Staff Development Centre, Sokoto in 1972. It is the staff development 
             centre that was later amalgamated with community development institute, BirninKebbi and Home
              economics Centre, Gusau, to constitute an arm called College of Administration Sokoto which
               formed part of the then polytechnic of Sokoto State, BirninKebbi in 1980.</p>

        <p class="main-background">
            The geographical division in the country in 1991 saw the creation of Kebbi State from the
             former Sokoto State. The former Sokoto State leadership of Col. Bashir Salihi Magashi
              thought it is desirable then to establish its own polytechnic at Talata Mafara, to take
               advantage of the existing structure meant for a technical college already there. 
               Still the college of administration Farfaru remained an integral part of the proposed 
               polytechnic and served as the temporary site.

                <div class="historical-background">
                    <p class="main-background">The laudable proposal eventually became a reality in 1992,
                         when His Excellency, the then Governor of Sokoto State Mallam Yahaya Abdulkarim 
                         signed the Bill establishing the polytechnic.  In Feb 1995, the Government of 
                         Sokoto State renamed the institution to Abdu Gusau Polytechnic after the Late 
                         Engr. Abdu Gusau who died in November 1994. This renaming was done in order to 
                         recognize the contribution of the Late Engineer who was the first engineer from 
                         the former Sokoto State.  In Oct. 1996 the Federal Government created Zamfara 
                         State out of the then Sokoto State, a situation which necessitated the hurried
                          relocation of the institution to its partially completed permanent site in 
                          TalataMafara as it was not possible legally for Zamfara State to continue to 
                          sustain an institution belonging to it but located in Sokoto State. By the end 
                          of 1996, the institution had completed its relocation paving way for the
                           commencement of the new session (1996/1997) by Feb. 1997. While being grateful
                            to Allah Almighty for making the movement possible, the management and the
                             State Government also appreciate the understanding and co-operation exhibited
                              by the staff, students, TalataMafara Local Government and the host Community
                               at that crucial moment. It is on record that the staff and students lived
                                and worked under extreme hardship at that time, while efforts were being,
                                 made to gradually ameliorate the situation. </p>
