            Gather information about the subject of your complaint.</b> It's more likely your complaint will be 
            resolved to your satisfaction if you have plenty of documentation and evidence of the incident or 
            incidents involved. Get specific names of people involved, including witnesses, as well as the time 
            of day and the location of the incident.[3]

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>  If school staff, teachers, or other students observed any of the incidents, 
                    contact them and ask if they'd be willing to give a statement about the incident
                     on the record.</li><br>
                     <li> The school may also have photos or video footage from security cameras 
                         that would also be helpful, depending on the location of the incident.</li>

                Review laws or school policies that might apply to your problem.</b>  When an incident 
                occurs at school that gives rise to a complaint, it may concern violations of school
                 policies, district policies, state laws or regulations, or even federal laws or 
                 regulations. While you don't necessarily have to know every law or regulation that
                  was potentially violated, it will strengthen your complaint if point to at least one 
                  violation that occurred.[4]

              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li>  The school handbook is a good source of school and school district policies that 
                      may have been violated. School handbooks also may have information about state and
                       federal laws. If you don't have a copy of the school handbook, chge from security cameras 
                           that would also be helpful, depending on the location of the incident.eck on the school's
                        website..</li><br>
                       <li> Students' or parents' rights organizations are also good sources of state and
                            federal law that governs schools. Use these resources to determine possible 
                            laws that were violated as a result of the incident.</li><br>
                            <li>For example, if your child is being bullied at school because of their
                                 race or ethnicity, that bullying potentially violates federal and state
                                  civil rights laws.</li>

            Draft a written letter of complaint.</b> Once you have all of your information together, draft a 
            formal written letter that provides details about your specific complaint. Generally, your 
            letter should have three parts:[5]

              </p>
              <br>
              <ul>
                  <li> In the first part of your letter, identify yourself and provide a brief statement
                       of the facts that gave rise to your complaint. Include as many specific details 
                       as possible, including the time and location of any incidents that occurred.</li><br>
                       <li>In the second part of your letter, briefly list the school policies and state
                            or federal rules or regulations you believe were violated.</li><br>
                            <li>In the final part of your letter, describe what you'd like to see happen as a result
                                 of your complaint and how long you're giving the school to make this happen. For
                                  example, if you were unfairly denied access to a location because of your disability
                                  , you might give the school 2 weeks to provide access or make alternate accommodations.

                    Discuss your problem with the school directly.</b> Generally, send your complaint letter
                     to the school first. You can find on the school's website or in the school handbook
                      the name and contact information of the administrative official who is in charge of
                       dealing with complaints.

                         better to mail your letter using certified mail with return receipt requested. That
                          way, you'll have proof that the school received your complaint if you need to get
                           higher authorities involved.</li><br>
                        <li>Typically, a school administrative official will contact you and offer options to 
                            resolve the situation. However, you may occasionally find that the school stonewalls
                             you or refuses to work with you to find a remedy for your issue. If that occurs, 
                             or if you don't find any of the options offered satisfactory, you may need to move
                              up the hierarchy..</li>

                                  additional documents or information to corroborate the facts you
                                   outlined in your complaint. </li>

                If your complaint is not resolved at the district level, you may be able to get satisfaction
                 through your H.O.D's department. Use the letter you originally submitted to the
                  district, adding information about when that letter was sent to the district and what the
